 *   |       |     +-------master_form.php - THIS SCRIPT
 *   |       |               (includes several includes and then $formName from
 *   |       |               users/local/ or users/us_core/)

 *   |             (accessed via url www.example.com/users/form1.php)
 *   |             (sets $formName to 'form1.php' and includes master_form.php)
 *   +-----form2.php
 *          (accessed via url www.example.com/form2.php)
 *          (sets $formName to 'form2.php' and includes master_form.php)
 *
 * You can move the users/x pages anywhere or rename them if it works better for
 * your web-site.
 *
 * DO NOT CHANGE THIS SCRIPT. If you wish to customize it, COPY IT TO users/local/forms/
 * and then modify it. (Be sure to get rid of the check for the customized version at
 * the very top.)
